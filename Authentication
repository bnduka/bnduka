	1. Brute force attacks - weak authentication mechanisms (unencrypted or non complex password)
These attacks are typically automated using wordlists of usernames and passwords.
	- During auditing, check whether the website discloses potential usernames publicly. 
	- check HTTP responses to see if any email addresses are disclosed

	2. Logic flaws or poor coding 
	
Vulnerabilities in password-based logins
Using Burp - I check status codes, error messages and response times
Enumerating username

	- Username = alpha //Incorrect password
	- Password = 12345678 //check status 302

Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication

	- Replacing the url of the victim with your own url after a successful login
Replacing your account cookie with the victim's account cookie. Then brute force the 2FA Token
